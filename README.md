# HTTP Middleware Trace

> Express middleware, assists in request tracing between services.


## Getting Started

```shell
npm install --save @cork-labs/http-middleware-trace
```

```javascript
// your application setup
const httpTrace = require('@cork-labs/http-middleware-trace');
app.use(httpTrace());

// your route
app.get('/path', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(res.trace.uuid);
})
```


## API

### res.trace: object

An object with the following attributes:

```json
{
  "uuid": "...", // read from http headers or generated by the middleware
  "current": "...", // always generated by ghe middleware
  "parent": "...",  // always read from http headers
  "ip": "...",  // always read from http header
}
```

By default, the middleware reads from specific http headers.

We certainly want to customise these.

```javascript
{
  uuid: 'x-cork-labs-req-trace-id',
  parent: 'x-cork-labs-req-parent-id',
  ip: 'x-cork-labs-client-ip'
}
```


## Configuration

The middleware can be configured via an options object when calling its factory function.

```javascript
const options = {
  headers: {
    uuid: 'x-trace-id'
  }
};
app.use(httpTrace(options));
```
